- A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is an Unsupervised Deep Learning technique. This architecture is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.

- An autoencoder is a special type of neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output.
